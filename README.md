# Computer Graphics Lab Repository

Welcome to the **Computer Graphics Lab Repository**!  
This repository serves as a platform for students to submit their computer graphics lab assignments. Each lab submission must follow the specified folder structure and include all necessary files to ensure uniformity and ease of evaluation.

---

## Repository Structure

Each student must create a folder using their **Name** and organize their lab submissions in the following structure:

```
/<Your-Name>
   â”œâ”€â”€ Lab_<Lab_Number>
       â”œâ”€â”€ code.py       # Python script containing the lab code
       â”œâ”€â”€ output.png    # Screenshot(s) of the program's output
       â”œâ”€â”€ algorithm.md  # Markdown file with the algorithm/steps implemented
```

### Example:

```
/12345
   â”œâ”€â”€ Lab_1
       â”œâ”€â”€ code.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ output.png
       â”œâ”€â”€ algorithm.md
   â”œâ”€â”€ Lab_2
       â”œâ”€â”€ code.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ output.png
       â”œâ”€â”€ algorithm.md
```

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Folder Naming:**
   - Use your **Name** as the name for your main folder.
   - Create a new subfolder for each lab, named as `Lab_<Lab_Number>` (e.g., `Lab_1` for the first lab).
   
2. **Required Files in Each Lab Folder:**
   - **Python Code (`code.py`):** Your complete lab solution in Python, with proper comments explaining key steps.
   - **Output Screenshot (`output.png`):** A screenshot of the program output demonstrating the correct implementation of the lab task.
   - **Algorithm (`algorithm.md`):** A concise and well-structured markdown file detailing the algorithm or steps implemented in your code.

3. **Completeness:**
   - Ensure that all required files are included in the appropriate format before submission.
